📋 AI Governance Checklist: PPE Detection System
Data Privacy & Anonymization 👤: Are we committed to ensuring that all video data is processed for safety compliance only, with faces blurred or data discarded once the check is complete?

Algorithmic Fairness & Bias Mitigation 🦺: Has the model been tested across a variety of PPE colors (e.g., yellow vs. orange vests) and environmental conditions (e.g., low light vs. bright sun) to ensure consistent performance?

Human-in-the-Loop Oversight 👨‍✈️: Is there a clear protocol stating that the AI acts as a decision-support tool for safety officers rather than an autonomous disciplinary system?

Reliability & Failure Protocols ⚠️: Do we have a plan for how the site should respond if the system experiences downtime or a high rate of false negatives (like the missed helmet we identified)?
